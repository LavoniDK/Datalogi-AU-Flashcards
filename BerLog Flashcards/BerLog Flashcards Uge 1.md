## Regular Expression and Languages

What is a regular language?::A regular language is a language that can be recognized by a finite automaton and can be described using regular expressions.

What are the three main operations used in regular expressions?
?
The three main operations in regular expressions are:
  - **Union** ($L_1 \cup L_2$): Combines two languages. 
  - **Concatenation** ($L_1 L_2$): Joins strings from two languages.
  - **Kleene star** ($L^*$): Allows repetition of strings from a language.


What is the recursive definition of regular languages?
?
The recursive definition of regular languages states:
  - **Base cases**: $\emptyset$, $\{\Lambda\}$, and $\{a\}$ (for every $a \in \Sigma$) are regular languages.
  - **Inductive step**: If $\mathcal{L}_1, \mathcal{L}_2$ are regular languages, then:
    - $\mathcal{L}_1 \cup \mathcal{L}_2$ (union) is regular.
    - $\mathcal{L}_1 \mathcal{L}_2$ (concatenation) is regular.
    - $\mathcal{L}_1^*$ (Kleene star) is regular.


What is the basis of regular expressions?
?
The basis of regular expressions consists of:
  - $\emptyset$ (empty set)
  - $\Lambda$ (empty string)
  - $a$ for each $a \in \Sigma$ (single-character expressions).

How are set operations represented in regular expressions?
?
Set operations in regular expressions are represented as:
  - **Union**: $\cup$ is replaced with `+` (e.g., $a \cup b$ â†’ `a + b`).
  - **Concatenation**: Implied by adjacency (e.g., `ab` means `a` followed by `b`).
  - **Kleene star**: Represented as `*` (e.g., $(a + b)^*$).


What does it mean for two regular expressions to be equivalent?
?
Two regular expressions are equivalent if they define the same language: $$E_1 = E_2 \Leftrightarrow \mathcal{L}(E_1) = \mathcal{L}(E_2)$$

## Deterministic Finite Automata

What is a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)?::A DFA is a theoretical model of computation that recognizes regular languages by processing input symbols one at a time and determining acceptance or rejection based on a finite set of states.

What are the key characteristics of a DFA?
?
  - **Input/Output Behavior**: Reads symbols one at a time and accepts or rejects the input.  
  - **Simplicity**: Uses a finite number of states and limited memory.  
  - **Operation**: Starts in an initial state, transitions based on input, and accepts if it reaches an accepting state.

How is a DFA formally defined?
?
A DFA is defined as a 5-tuple $M = (Q, \Sigma, q_0, A, \delta)$, where:  
  - $Q$: Finite set of states.  
  - $\Sigma$: Input alphabet.  
  - $q_0 \in Q$: Initial state.  
  - $A \subseteq Q$: Accepting states.  
  - $\delta: Q \times \Sigma \to Q$: Transition function.

What is the extended transition function in a DFA?
?
The extended transition function $\delta^*$ is recursively defined as:  
  1. $\delta^*(q, \Lambda) = q$  
  2. $\delta^*(q, aw) = \delta^*(\delta(q, a), w)$  

What is the intuition behind the extended transition function $\delta^*$ in a DFA?
?
The extended transition function $\delta^*$ defines how a DFA processes an entire string recursively.  
  - It starts in the initial state and processes the input symbol by symbol.
  - For an empty string $\Lambda$, the DFA stays in the same state.
  - For a non-empty string $aw$, it first processes $a$, transitioning to a new state, and then recursively processes the rest of $w$.
  - This allows $\delta^*$ to determine the final state reached after consuming an entire input string.  

What is the acceptance condition of a DFA?::A string $w \in \Sigma^*$ is accepted if $\delta^*(q_0, w) \in A$.

What is an incomplete DFA?::An incomplete DFA is one where the transition function $\delta$ is **partial**, meaning some transitions are undefined.

How can an incomplete DFA be completed?::An incomplete DFA can be completed by adding an explicit **error state** (trap state) that absorbs all undefined transitions.

What operations on languages can be implemented using DFAs?::DFAs can be constructed to accept the **union, intersection, difference, or complement** of two regular languages.

How can a DFA be constructed for the union, intersection, or difference of two languages?
?
A composite DFA can be constructed by combining the states of two DFAs:  
  - **Union**: Accepts if at least one DFA accepts.  
  - **Intersection**: Accepts if both DFAs accept.  
  - **Difference**: Accepts if the first DFA accepts and the second does not.

What is the state explosion problem in composite automata?::The number of states in a composite DFA can be as large as $|Q_1| \times |Q_2|$, though many are often unnecessary.

How can composite automata be optimized?::Unreachable or redundant states can be removed, and minimization techniques can reduce the number of states to the smallest possible DFA.
