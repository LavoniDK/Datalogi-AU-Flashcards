# Datalogi-AU-Flashcards

To use these flashcards you must copy the files to your obsidian vault, also the plug-in 'Spaced Repition' (using default settings) should be installed and enabled. 

The tag below each flaschard ex. <!--SR:!2025-02-01,3,259--> stores data about review date, current interval and current ease score, that the plug-in uses for planning you flashcard review schedule. Since i have already reviewed most flashcards before committing here, you should remove the tag before you review them for the first time. To do this you can use the Regex Find/Replace plug in an search for the regex `<!--SR:!\d{4}-\d{2}-\d{2},\d+,\d+-->`
